# Sentinet


In the age of big data customer feedback is a very important factor that drives business profit. Customer feedback data is being generated in a very large amount for all kinds of business. To go through the reviews manually and get insights is a mere impossible task. Thus we built SENTINET which employs extensive machine learning and deep learning concepts to perform a wide range of text analysis . The tool performs Sentiment Analysis(positive,negative reviews), Emotion Analysis(happy,angry,sad,excited,love reviews), Hate Speech Detection in the reviews and shows categorical and region wise visualisation and insights. Through these powerful visual insights a stakeholder can find out which category of business makes the customer unhappy and also find insights based on regions. Moreover the tool is fully developed and has been deployed over the cloud. All one needs to do is to connect their customer feedback database with SENTINET to get insights on the fly. Thus, SENTINET provides a next generation customer relation service. The front end visualisations are dynamic w.r.t datasets.
