# Sentinet


In the age of big data customer feedback is a very important factor that drives business profit. Customer feedback data is being generated in a very large amount for all kinds of business. To go through the reviews manually and get insights is a mere impossible task. Thus we built SENTINET which employs extensive machine learning and deep learning concepts to perform a wide range of text analysis . The tool performs Sentiment Analysis(positive,negative reviews), Emotion Analysis(happy,angry,sad,excited,love reviews), Hate Speech Detection in the reviews and shows categorical and region wise visualisation and insights. Through these powerful visual insights a stakeholder can find out which category of business makes the customer unhappy and also find insights based on regions.
